# Set the default behavior, in case people don't have core.autocrlf set. All files
# matching the filter will be converted (CRLF to LF) if those files
# are determined by Git to be text and not binary. This relies on Git's built in
# binary detection heuristics.

* text=auto


# Denote all files that are truly binary and should not be modified. Just in case (we do not
# really trust Git's binary detection)

# images
*.png binary
*.jpg binary
*.ico binary
*.gif binary
*.jpeg binary
*.webp binary


# fonts
*.eot binary
*.svg binary
*.ttf binary
*.otf binary
*.woff binary


# Explicitly declare text files you want to always be normalized and converted
# to native line endings on checkout.
# Git will run CRLF to LF replacement on these files every time they are written
# to the object database and the reverse replacement will be run when writing out
# to the working directory

# *.c text
# *.h text


# Declare files that will always have CRLF line endings on checkout.

# *.sln text eol=crlf
