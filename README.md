## Contributing ##

If you would like to contribute code, please do the following:

1. Fork this repository and make your changes.
2. Write tests for any new functionality. If you are fixing a bug that tests did not cover, please make a test that reproduces the bug.
3. Add your name to the "contributors" section in the `package.json` file.
4. Squash all of your commits into a single commit via `git rebase -i`.
5. Run the tests by running `npm install && npm test` from the source directory.
6. Assuming those pass, send the Pull Request off to me for review!

Please do not iterate the package.json version number – I will do that myself when I publish it to NPM.
